            <p>The key to all our building and refurbishment projects is detail from early in the planning stage, right through to completion of the project. Product detail and in depth knowledge of available materials provides us with a unique advantage as much of our work relates to advanced material usage, highly technical modern design incorporating bespoke furnishings and modern sound, lighting, entertainment and security system requirements.</p>
            <p>Our various departmental teams provide clients with complete peace of mind that their properties are safe and are being well looked after.  We will take responsibility for the interpretation of your brief, coordinating the design team, managing the construction work, ensuring all the necessary consents are obtained and finally, delivering the project to your satisfaction.  With a single point of contact, your manager will liaise with you or your representative and actively manage the entire project on your behalf.  You will be kept fully informed on all aspects of the project, with regular meetings and reports throughout the duration of the project.  We are dedicated to bringing you a first class, personalised service</p>
